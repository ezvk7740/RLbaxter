# SRL Models

A State Representation Learning (SRL) model aims to compress from a high dimensional observation, a compact representation.
This learned representation can be used instead of learning a policy directly from pixels, in a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.  

(A more detailed overview: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04181.pdf)

## Available models
- autoencoder: an autoencoder from the raw pixels
- ground_truth: the agent's position
- robotic_priors: robotic priors model ([Learning State Representations with Robotic Priors](http://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg170/Publikationen_pdf/Jonschkowski-15-AURO.pdf))
- supervised: a supervised model from the raw pixels to the agent's position
- pca: pca applied to the raw pixels
- vae: a variational autoencoder from the raw pixels
- inverse: an inverse dynamics model
- forward: a forward dynamics model
- srl_combination: a model combining several losses (e.g. vae + forward + inverse...) for SRL
- multi_view_srl: a SRL model using views from multiple cameras as input, with any of the above losses (e.g triplet and others)
- joints: the arm's joints angles (kuka environments only)
- joints_position: the arm's x,y,z position and joints angles (kuka environments only)

## Add your own
If your SRL model is a charateristic of the environment (position, angles, ...):  
1. Add the name of the model to the ```registered_srl``` dictionary in ```state_representation/registry.py```,
using this format ```NAME: (SRLType.ENVIRONMENT, [LIMITED_TO_ENV])```, where:
    * ```NAME```: is your model's name.
    * ```[LIMITED_TO_ENV]```: is the list of environments where this model works (will check for subclass),
    set to ```None``` if this model applies to every environment.
2. Modifiy the ```def getSRLState(self, observation)``` in the environments to return the data you want for this model.  
3. Now you can call your SRL model using ```--srl-model NAME``` with ```train.py``` or ```pipeline.py```.  

Otherwise, for the SRL model that are external to the environment (Supervised, autoencoder, ...):
1. Add your SRL model that inherits ```SRLBaseClass```, to the function ```state_representation.models.loadSRLModel```.
2. Add the name of the model to the ```registered_srl``` dictionary in ```state_representation/registry.py```,
using this format ```NAME: (SRLType.SRL, [LIMITED_TO_ENV])```, where:
    * ```NAME```: is your model's name.
    * ```[LIMITED_TO_ENV]```: is the list of environments where this model works (will check for subclass),
    set to ```None``` if this model applies to every environment.
3. Add the name of the model to ```config/srl_models.yaml```, with the location of the saved model for each environment (can point to a dummy location, but must be defined).
4. Now you can call your SRL model using ```--srl-model NAME``` with ```train.py``` or ```pipeline.py```.
