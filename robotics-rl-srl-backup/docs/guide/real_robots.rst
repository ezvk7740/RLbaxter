Working With Real Robots: Baxter and Robobo
===========================================

Baxter Robot with Gazebo and ROS
--------------------------------

Gym Wrapper for baxter environment, more details in the dedicated README
(environments/gym_baxter/README.md).

.. warning::

  ROS (and Gazebo + Baxter) only works with python2, whereas this repo (except the ROS scripts) works with python3.
  For Ros/Baxter installation, please look at the `Official Tutorial <http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup>`__.
  Also, ROS comes with its own version of OpenCV, so when running the
  python3 scripts, you need to deactivate ROS. In the same vein, if you
  use Anaconda, you need to disable it when you want to run ROS scripts
  (denoted as python 2 in the following instructions).

0. Download ROS packages (ROS kinetic) and install them in your catkin workspace:

-  `arm scenario experiments`_, branch “rl”
-  `arm scenario simulator`_ branch kinetic-devel

.. _arm scenario experiments: https://github.com/NataliaDiaz/arm_scenario_experiments/tree/rl
.. _arm scenario simulator: https://github.com/araffin/arm_scenario_simulator


1. Start ros nodes (Python 2):

::

   roslaunch arm_scenario_simulator baxter_world.launch
   rosrun arm_scenario_simulator spawn_objects_example

   python -m real_robots.gazebo_server

Then, you can either try to teleoperate the robot (python 3):

::

   python -m real_robots.teleop_client

or test the environment with random actions (using the gym wrapper):

::

   python -m environments.gym_baxter.test_baxter_env

If the port is already used, you can see the program pid using the
following command:

::

   sudo netstat -lpn | grep :7777

and then kill it (with ``kill -9 program_pid``)

or in one line:

::

   kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:7777`

Working With a Real Baxter Robot
--------------------------------

WARNING: Please read COMPLETELY the following instructions before
running and experiment on a real baxter.

Recording Data With a Random Agent for SRL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Change you environment to match baxter ROS settings (usually using
   the ``baxter.sh`` script from RethinkRobotics) or in your .bashrc:

::

   # NB: This is only an example
   export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.0.211  # Your IP
   export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://baxter.local:11311 # Baxter IP

2. Calibrate the different values in ``real_robots/constants.py`` using
   ``real_robots/real_baxter_debug.py``:

-  Set USING_REAL_BAXTER to True
-  Position of the target: BUTTON_POS
-  Init position and orientation: LEFT_ARM_INIT_POS,
   LEFT_ARM_ORIENTATION
-  Position of the table (minimum z): Z_TABLE
-  Distance below which the target is considered to be reached:
   DIST_TO_TARGET_THRESHOLD
-  Distance above which the agent will get a negative reward:
   MAX_DISTANCE
-  Maximum number of steps per episode: MAX_STEPS

3. Configure images topics in ``real_robots/constants.py``:

-  IMAGE_TOPIC: main camera
-  SECOND_CAM_TOPIC: second camera (set it to None if you don't want to
   use a second camera)
-  DATA_FOLDER_SECOND_CAM: folder where the images of the second camera
   will be saved

4. Launch ROS bridge server (python 2):

::

   python -m real_robots.real_baxter_server

5. Deactivate ROS from your environment and switch to python 3
   environment (for using this repo)

6. Set the number of episodes you want to record, name of the experiment
   and random seed in ``environments/gym_baxter/test_baxter_env.py``

7. Record data using a random agent:

::

   python -m environments.gym_baxter.test_baxter_env

8. Wait until the end... Note: the real robot runs at approximately 0.6
   FPS.

NB: If you want to save the image without resizing, you need to comment
the line in the method ``getObservation()`` in
``environments/gym_baxter/baxter_env.py``

RL on a Real Baxter Robot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Update the settings in ``rl_baselines/train.py``, so it saves and log
   the training more often (LOG_INTERVAL, SAVE_INTERVAL, ...)

2. Make sure that USING_REAL_BAXTER is set to True in
   ``real_robots/constants.py``.

3. Launch ROS bridge server (python 2):

::

   python -m real_robots.real_baxter_server

4. Start visdom for visualizing the training

::

   python -m visdom.server

4. Train the agent (python 3)

::

   python -m rl_baselines.train --srl-model ground_truth --log-dir logs_real/ --num-stack 1 --shape-reward --algo ppo2 --env Baxter-v0

Working With a Real Robobo
--------------------------

`Robobo
Documentation <https://bitbucket.org/mytechia/robobo-programming/wiki/Home>`__

Note: the Robobo is controlled using time (the feedback frequency is too
low to do closed-loop control) The robot was calibrated for a constant
speed of 10.

.. _recording-data-with-a-random-agent-for-srl-1:

Recording Data With a Random Agent for SRL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Change you environment to match Robobo ROS settings or in your
   .bashrc: NOTE: Robobo is using ROS Java, if you encounter any problem
   with the cameras (e.g. with a xtion), you should create the master
   node on your computer and change the settings in the robobo dev app.

::

   # NB: This is only an example
   export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.0.211  # Your IP
   export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://robobo.local:11311 # Robobo IP

2. Calibrate the different values in ``real_robots/constants.py`` using
   ``real_robots/real_robobo_server.py`` and
   ``real_robots/teleop_client.py`` (Client for teleoperation):

-  Set USING_ROBOBO to True
-  Area of the target: TARGET_INITIAL_AREA
-  Boundaries of the enviroment: (MIN_X, MAX_X, MIN_Y, MAX_Y)
-  Maximum number of steps per episode: MAX_STEPS IMPORTANT NOTE: if you
   use color detection to detect the target, you need to calibrate the
   HSV thresholds ``LOWER_RED`` and ``UPPER_RED`` in
   ``real_robots/constants.py`` (for instance, using `this
   script <https://github.com/sergionr2/RacingRobot/blob/v0.3/opencv/dev/threshold.py>`__).
   Be careful, you may have to change the color conversion
   (``cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV`` instead of ``cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV``)

3. Configure images topics in ``real_robots/constants.py``:

-  IMAGE_TOPIC: main camera
-  SECOND_CAM_TOPIC: second camera (set it to None if you don't want to
   use a second camera)
-  DATA_FOLDER_SECOND_CAM: folder where the images of the second camera
   will be saved

NOTE: If you want to use robobo's camera (phone camera), you need to
republish the image to the raw format:

::

   rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/camera/image raw out:=/camera/image_repub

4. Launch ROS bridge server (python 2):

::

   python -m real_robots.real_robobo_server

5. Deactivate ROS from your environment and switch to python 3
   environment (for using this repo)

6. Set the number of episodes you want to record, name of the experiment
   and random seed in ``environments/robobo_gym/test_robobo_env.py``

7. Record data using a random agent:

::

   python -m environments.robobo_gym.test_robobo_env

8. Wait until the end... Note: the real robobo runs at approximately 0.1
   FPS.

NB: If you want to save the image without resizing, you need to comment
the line in the method ``getObservation()`` in
``environments/robobo_gym/robobo_env.py``

RL on a Real Robobo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Update the settings in ``rl_baselines/train.py``, so it saves and
   logs the training more often (LOG_INTERVAL, SAVE_INTERVAL, ...)

2. Make sure that USING_ROBOBO is set to True in
   ``real_robots/constants.py``.

3. Launch ROS bridge server (python 2):

::

   python -m real_robots.real_robobo_server

4. Start visdom for visualizing the training

::

   python -m visdom.server

4. Train the agent (python 3)

::

   python -m rl_baselines.train --srl-model ground_truth --log-dir logs_real/ --num-stack 1 --algo ppo2 --env RoboboGymEnv-v0
